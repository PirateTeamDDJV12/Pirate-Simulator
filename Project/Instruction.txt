Put here every project directory of this big project.

Those repositories must contain a :
-> .sln
-> .vcxproj
-> .vcxproj.filter
-> the "main.cpp"
-> When finished, a ".exe" that can be used as unitary test
-> other not so important files and directory


Do not forget that the relative path for the header file and source file must be setted in 
your Visual Studio property window.
I know it is annoying but you'll see, you will gain a lot of time in the future and avoid a lot
of nerve-wracking debugging session just by doing so.
