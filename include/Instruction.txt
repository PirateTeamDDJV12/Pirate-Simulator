Put here every header file (".h", ".hpp", ...) of the project.


If your Visual studio is well configured and you follow those instructions, you can :

-> Access it from the src cpp in your project by :
#include "../include/NameOfYourHeader.h"

-> Access it from the main.cpp (in the same directory of your vcxproj) by :
#include "../../../include/NameOfYourHeader.h"



Do not forget that the relative path for the header file must be setted in your Visual Studio
property window.
I know it is annoying but you'll see, you will gain a lot of time in the future and avoid a lot
of nerve-wracking debugging session just by doing so.
